# CRTGuitarAmp
- 2 ~5 inch CRTs pulled from old karaoke machines biased by and isolated rectified 169V
- 2 gain stages, roughly symmetric
- Not impedance matched for a speacker, should only be used to raise a signal to line lever, not power amplification

- Working on a schematic for public release
